Status:
    This is the final version of dreamup.
    In order to run debug of the app first you must have npm installed then you must run 'npm install' in order to get the necessary packages.
    After that you must run 'react-native start -- --reset cache' in one window to start the local dev server and 'react-native run-android' in a second window to install the app on the connected emulator/device

    If you want to avoid running a local server and downloading packages a signed apk can found in the project at:
    DreamUp\android\app\release\DreamApp.apk
    This apk should be easily installed once transferred to the desired emulator/device.
